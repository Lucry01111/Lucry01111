  ## 👩‍💻 Who am I?

Hi! I’m Lucrezia 👋, a Computer Science student 🎓 based in Rome 🇮🇹. 
My programming journey started at the age of 15 with my first programming language, Visual Basic 🖥️. 
I began writing small and simple code snippets, which, over time and with more practice, quickly evolved into a deep passion for programming 💻.

Subsequently, I decided to teach myself Python 🐍. This opened my eyes to the vast possibilities that programming offers and made me realize that I wanted to learn and master as many programming languages as possible. Since then, I’ve been dedicated to expanding my skills, exploring new languages and technologies with enthusiasm and curiosity 🚀.
